		<p>If you’ve ever wondered whether you could make a real contribution to the world but aren’t sure you have any really 
		meaningful talents, perhaps you should look at how you play computer games. A growing body of research suggests that 
		the virtual world can show you what you are truly capable of.</p>
		<p>While some people see video games as a means of living out fantasy, the truth is who we are in the virtual world 
		largely reflects who we are in the real one. For instance, one <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2017/6531404/">piece of research</a> has found that a player’s real values 
		match their in-game decisions, suggesting that their true personality often gets reflected in a game scenario. There 
		is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260910284_Friending_your_way_up_the_ladder_Connecting_massive_multiplayer_online_game_behaviors_with_offline_leadership"> also evidence</a>
		 that our ability to lead is strongly reflected in the way we form relationships in video games.
		</p>
		<p>Some of us are fortunate enough to be aware of these kinds of skills and can take advantage of them in real life 
		as well as in the virtual world. Some players even list their in-game achievements <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-warcraft-game-skills-help-land-a-job-1407885660">on their CVs</a>. But there are also 
		many people who are capable of much more than they realise. In fact, the above research suggests that the in-game 
		decisions we make and the behaviour we show while playing can tell us about value systems and skills that are, perhaps,
		 unconscious.
		</p>
		<p>This is because when we are playing in an engaging simulated scenario, we can enter a state of “flow”. This is
		 a psychological phenomenon characterised by an extreme focus on tasks, an innate sense of joy, matching our skill
		  level with the level of challenge and, interestingly, a total lack of self-consciousness. In other words, we are 
		  so involved in the game scenario that we are reacting more authentically instead of filtering behaviour through 
		  our perceived social expectations and rules.
		</p>
		<p>Given that these characteristics often stay in the area of game play and aren’t put to use in the real world,
		 there is a clear need to make people more aware that games have this revelatory power. At the very least, there
		  should be a way for the persistence, problem-solving skills and motivation of many game players to be 
		  transferred to their ordinary working lives.
		</p>

		<p>After realising this need, I am developing a system to help people uncover these traits and ultimately lead 
		better lives. The system comprises two sections. The first part is a game that allows players to solve problems 
		in a variety of ways and exposes the kind of unconscious qualities mentioned above. The software monitors the 
		behaviour and choices made during play and logs them in a unique profile for that player.
		</p>
		<p>Drawing on research that categorises gamers according to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1541902">what motivates them</a>
		 to play, the game will let 
		players choose between actions that indicate skill levels and personality types, as defined by tests such 
		as <a href="https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1">Myers Briggs</a>.
		These actions could include putting items together for tool making for solving problems,
		choosing to explore new areas alone, or even how one player converses with another.
